# Solana Monitoring Integration PRD
# OpenZeppelin Monitor

## Overview
This document outlines the requirements and implementation plan for integrating Solana blockchain monitoring capabilities into the OpenZeppelin Monitor system, leveraging Carbon's Solana monitoring features.

## Goals
- Enable monitoring of Solana blockchain transactions and events
- Maintain consistency with existing EVM and Stellar monitoring patterns
- Provide robust filtering and matching capabilities for Solana-specific features

## Non-Goals
- Full replication of Carbon's entire feature set
- Support for Solana-specific features not relevant to monitoring
- Changes to existing EVM or Stellar monitoring functionality

## Technical Requirements

### 1. Architecture Components

#### 1.1 Solana Filter Module
- Location: `src/services/filter/filters/solana/`
- Components:
  - `filter.rs`: Main filter implementation
  - `helpers.rs`: Solana-specific helper functions
  - Integration with existing `BlockFilter` trait

#### 1.2 Data Models
- New Solana-specific types in `models/`:
  - `SolanaTransaction`
  - `SolanaBlock`
  - `SolanaInstruction`
  - `SolanaAccount`
  - `SolanaMonitorMatch`

#### 1.3 Client Implementation
- Solana RPC client integration
- Support for:
  - Transaction monitoring
  - Account state changes
  - Program interactions
  - Event filtering

### 2. Feature Requirements

#### 2.1 Transaction Monitoring
- Support for monitoring:
  - Transaction signatures
  - Transaction status
  - Fee information
  - Timestamp data
  - Program invocations

#### 2.2 Account Monitoring
- Track account state changes
- Monitor account balance changes
- Support for account data parsing
- Program account interactions

#### 2.3 Program Monitoring
- Program invocation detection
- Instruction data parsing
- Cross-program invocation tracking
- Program state changes

#### 2.4 Event Filtering
- Support for:
  - Program events
  - Account events
  - Transaction events
  - Custom event filtering

### 3. Integration Points

#### 3.1 Existing System Integration
- Integration with current monitor system
- Compatibility with existing alert mechanisms
- Support for current configuration formats
- Maintain existing API patterns

#### 3.2 Carbon Integration
- Leverage Carbon's:
  - Transaction processing
  - Account state tracking
  - Program interaction detection
  - Event parsing capabilities

3. Develop program interaction detection
4. Create event filtering system

### Phase 3: Integration
1. Integrate with existing monitor system
2. Implement alert mechanisms
3. Add configuration support
4. Create documentation

### Phase 4: Testing & Validation
1. Unit test implementation
2. Integration testing
3. Performance testing
4. Security review

## Success Metrics
- Successful monitoring of Solana transactions
- Accurate event detection and filtering
- Performance within acceptable ranges
- Successful integration with existing systems
- Comprehensive test coverage

## Dependencies
- Solana RPC client
- Carbon's Solana monitoring components
- Existing OpenZeppelin Monitor infrastructure

   - Monitor system resource usage

2. Integration Complexity
   - Mitigation: Phased implementation
   - Regular integration testing

3. Data Consistency
   - Mitigation: Robust error handling
   - Data validation at each step

## Timeline
- Phase 1: 2 weeks
- Phase 2: 3 weeks
- Phase 3: 2 weeks
- Phase 4: 1 week
Total: 8 weeks

## Future Considerations
- Support for additional Solana features
- Enhanced program interaction monitoring
